## Site List:<sup>*</sup>
<sup>*: This list solely covers all providers I know that are out there, and actually functioning. They have been mentioned before elsewhere, but they're all collected now in one spot.</sup>

### AI Chat Websites / "Potential gpt4free Providers":
<sup>If you decide to reverse a site from the list below, it would be a great community service for you to add your code to xtekky's gpt4free github, as it is best to share your sources :)</sup>
This list can indeed be split into multiple parts to better organize the data. It seems useful to segregate the sites based on the model they offer. The three main categories are GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and ambiguous situations where the GPT version is still being ascertained or potentially upgradeable (let's call these "Uncertain/Potential GPT-4"?).
